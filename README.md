# Sallybot
Sallybot is a telegram bot for horoscope. 

### *Install the pyTelegramBotAPI library using pip:*
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI

### *How to Get Your Bot Token*
To set up a new bot, we will need to talk to BotFather.
1. Search for @botfather in Telegram.
2. Start a conversation with BotFather by clicking on the Start button.
3. Type /newbot, and follow the prompts to set up a new bot. The BotFather will give you a token that you will use to authenticate your bot and grant it access to the Telegram API.

*Note:* Make sure you store the token securely. Anyone with your token access can easily manipulate your bot.

### *Recommended Next Steps*
As of now, the bot stops working as soon as we stop our Python application. In order to make it run always, you can deploy the bot on platforms like Heroku, Render, and so on.
